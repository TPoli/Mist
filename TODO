zombies should use heatmaps / direct line of sight to path.
humans should use A* to navigate to their tasks + away from zombies.

path smoothing
when using a tile for pathing instead of using the center point instead set the point to move to to be offset from the center based on entry point and exit point
for example if exiting throughg the left and entering from the right set 2 points, 1 vertically centered
30% from the right most edge and another vertically centered and 30% from the left
take into account the ability to cut corners

for example if in the following case 
S,_,_,_		1,2,3,4
_,_,_,E		5,6,7,8

path should look something like 1BR,2BL,2BR,3BL,8TL,8Center
